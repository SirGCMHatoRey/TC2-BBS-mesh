"""Shared shapes for conversation flows.

A Flow is a deep module owning one conversation topic (mail, bulletins,
stats, ...). It is *pure*: ``advance(message, state, deps)`` computes what to
say and where the conversation goes next, and returns it — it never sends
messages, touches the radio, or reaches for a global. The router at the seam
does the sending; the collaborators a flow needs are handed in via ``Deps``.

A flow's answer is a :class:`FlowResult`: what to say (``replies`` and
``notifications``) and one :class:`Outcome` saying where the conversation goes
next. The outcome is a single value, not a set of flags, so a flow cannot ask
to enter a flow *and* show a menu at once — there is nowhere to write both.
Build one with the ``stay`` / ``end`` / ``keep`` / ``goto`` / ``enter`` helpers.
