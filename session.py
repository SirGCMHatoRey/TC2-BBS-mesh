"""Session — where every Node stands in its conversation, and how it advances.

The Session owns the per-node state (the topic, step, and half-entered content
that CONTEXT.md calls a Session) and the map from a topic to the flow that runs
it. Its interface is two methods:

    session.advance(node, message, deps) -> [(destination, text), ...]
    session.check_timeouts(deps_factory) -> [(destination, text), ...]

The router feeds a message in and sends the outbound messages out; it never
learns what a step is. check_timeouts is the same idea without an inbound
message — driven by the idle loop instead, it finishes any compose a node has
gone quiet on. Because the state lives on the object rather than in a module
global, two Sessions are independent and a test constructs one instead of
clearing a global (see docs/adr/0004).
