# Application state is passed, not global

The live state of a running BBS — where each Node stands in its conversation,
the database connection, the parsed configuration — is owned by an object and
handed to whoever needs it. No module holds mutable state on the conversation
path.

We are recording this as a decision because the codebase does not yet obey it.
Three modules still keep their state in module-level globals:

| Module | The global | Substituted in tests by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `utils` | `user_states = {}` | `utils.user_states.clear()` |
| `db_operations` | `thread_local.connection` | assigning over `get_db_connection` |
| `settings` | seven cached values behind `configure()`/`reset()` | `settings.reset()` |

The counter-example is already in the repo. `Js8Database` owns its path and its
connection and is constructed with `":memory:"` in tests. Nothing is reassigned,
nothing leaks between tests, and the seam is an argument rather than a
monkeypatch. `db_operations` is the same kind of thing wearing a different shape.

## Why it matters

A module-level global is a seam you cannot see in any interface. Tests reach
past `Store`, past `Session`, past every seam this project built, and rebind a
name. The interface stops being the test surface.

It also costs us process isolation. `run_tests.py` runs each file in its own
interpreter precisely so that one file's substitute cannot leak into the next.
That is a real constraint bought to hide a design problem, and it will be paid
again by anyone who later wants a shared fixture, a coverage run, or pytest.

## Consequences

- `Session` should hold the Session — the concept `CONTEXT.md` defines as a
  Node's current topic, step, and half-entered content. Today it is a dict in
  `utils`, and the router reaches into it.
- The BBS store should be a `Database` object, symmetrical with `Js8Database`.
- Configuration should be a value read once and passed down, not a lazily
  cached module.
- Once all three are done, the suite can share one interpreter and
  `run_tests.py` can stop spawning a process per file.

## What this does not mean

Immutable module-level constants are fine — `board.BOARDS`, the wire-format
prefixes, menu labels. The rule is about *mutable* state that a running BBS
changes, and that a test wants to replace.

Nor does it mean threading every dependency through every call. `Deps` already
exists as the channel a Flow receives its collaborators through. The point is
that the collaborators are handed over, not reached for.
